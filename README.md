# My Terminal Setup

This repo is meant to keep track of the dirrefent CLI tools that made my life easier for future reference.

## What terminal tho ?

I use ZSH terminal because it offers a variety of plugins and themes that will definitely appeal to all tastes. <br>
I also use [Oh My Zsh](https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh) which is a framework for managing your zsh configuration with sevral plugins andthemes. <br>
And to finish, I use rocking [Powerlevel10k](https://github.com/romkatv/powerlevel10k) as my theme becuase it doesn't only look cool, but it's a great help when dealing with git repos.

## The cherry on top

Everytime I open my terminal I'm greeted with this AWEOSME Rick and Morty that I made myself (check it [here](startup)), I hope you'll appreciate this, even if you're not a fan of the animated tv show.
