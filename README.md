# My Terminal Setup

This repo is meant to keep track of the dirrefent CLI tools that made my life easier for future reference.

## What terminal tho ?

I use ZSH terminal because it offers a variety of plugins and themes that will definitely appeal to all tastes. <br>
I also use [Oh My Zsh](https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh) which is a framework for managing your zsh configuration with sevral plugins andthemes. <br>
And to finish, I use rocking [Powerlevel10k](https://github.com/romkatv/powerlevel10k) as my theme becuase it doesn't only look cool, but it's a great help when dealing with git repos.

## The cherry on top

Everytime I open my terminal I'm greeted with this AWEOSME Rick and Morty that I made myself (check it [here](startup)), I hope you'll appreciate this, even if you're not a fan of the animated tv show.

## What I'm using

- **FZF**
  ![FZF](img/fzf.jpg) <br>
  FZF stands for “fuzzy finder”. It’s a general-purpose tool that lets you find files, commands in the history, processes, git commits, and more using a fuzzy search.

- **TMUX**
  ![Tmux](img/tmux.png) <br>
  Tmux is a terminal multiplexer for Unix-like operating systems. It allows multiple terminal sessions to be accessed simultaneously in a single window.

- **ripgrep**
  ![rg](img/rg.gif) <br>
  Ripgrep is an alternative to the grep command - **much faster one**, with sane defaults and colorized output. <br>
  It skips files ignored by .gitignore and hidden ones
- **htop**
  ![htop](img/htop.jpg) <br>
  To put it as simple as possible, htop is top on steroids - colorful, with plenty of options, and overall more comfortable to use.
- **ctop**
  ![ctop](img/ctop.gif) <br>
  ctop is a top-like interface for Docker containers. It gives you:
  - A list of running and stopped containers
  - Statistics like memory usage, CPU, and an additional detailed window for each container (with open ports and other information)
  - A quick menu to stop, kill, or show logs of a given container
- **Lazy Docker**
  ![lazydocker](img/lazydocker.gif) <br>
  It’s a full-fledged terminal UI for managing Docker with even more features.
- **Asciinema**
  ![asciinema](img/asciinema.jpg) <br>
  asciinema is a tool that you can use to record your terminal sessions. But, unlike recording GIFs, it will let your viewers select and copy the code from those recordings!
- **Tree**
  ![tree](img/tree.png) <br>
  If you want to present the content of a given directory, tree is a go-to tool to do that. It displays all the subdirectories and files in a nice, tree-like structure:
- **Bat**
  ![bat](img/bat.jpg) <br>
  Like cat but better, adds syntax highlighting, git gutter marks (when applicable), automatic paging (if the file is large), and in general, makes the output much more enjoyable to read.
